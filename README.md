# THE EATING CLUB

The web-based system was designed to simplify the process of booking a table from any restaurant. The Restaurant Management System is an online tool that helps restaurants run more smoothly. It automates tasks like customers to choose
menus, taking reservations, and tracking booking status, which can free up staff and improve customer service. The system also helps restaurants use their resources more efficiently, which can save them money.
